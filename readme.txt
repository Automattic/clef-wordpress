Futuristic two-factor that people love to use: no passwords or temporary codes, single sign on/off, prevents password attacks.

== Description ==

[Clef](https://getclef.com) replaces passwords with beautifully simple, strongly encrypted two-factor authentication using [your smartphone](getclef.com/apps). Watch [our 30-second demonstration](http://vimeo.com/77091221).

http://vimeo.com/77091221

= Features =

- **Strong authentication**: Clef [replaces passwords](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/05/why-we-need-real-cryptography-instead-of-passwords/) with encrypted authentication using the well respected [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) public key cryptosystem.

- **Comprehensive password protection**: Clef disables passwords at [all three WP password authentication vectors](http://support.getclef.com/article/50-how-to-use-the-password-settings-in-clefs-wordpress-plugin#vectors): DashBoard access, API access, and automatic password resets via e-mail.

- **Fine-tuned control**: Clefâ€™s powerful [settings](http://support.getclef.com/article/50-how-to-use-the-password-settings-in-clefs-wordpress-plugin) allow you to selectively disable passwords and to accommodate [users without smartphones](http://support.getclef.com/article/57-how-does-clef-accommodate-wordpress-logins-for-users-who-do-not-have-smartphones).

- **Single sign on/off**: Clef makes administering multiple WP sites a breeze. Sign in once at your first Clef-enabled site, and you are automatically signed in to all of your subsequent Clef-enabled sites. Also, thanks to the customizable timer you are automatically logged out of all your sites after the duration of your choosing.

- **[Login button shortcode](http://support.getclef.com/article/56-how-do-i-use-the-clef-login-shortcode)**: insert the Clef login button or embedded Clef Wave in any post, page, or widget using the **clef_render_login_button** shortcode.

- **Multisite network support**

- **[Internationalization support](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wpclef/)**: Danish, Dutch, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish. More on the way; [contributions welcome](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wpclef/).

- **Fulsome [documentation](http://support.getclef.com/collection/1-wordpress)** 

- **Free [e-mail support](mailto:support@getclef.com)**

== Installation ==

= Installing the Plugin =

Install Clef automatically from your WordPress Dashboard by selecting "Plugins" and then "Add New" from the sidebar menu. Search for Clef, and then choose "Install Now."

Or:

1. Download the latest version of Clef for WordPress (via the download button at the top right).
1. Unzip the archive and upload the `wpclef` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your WordPress site.
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress

= Getting Started =

1. If you don't already have a Clef account, download the Clef app for your [iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clef/id558706348?ls=1&mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.clef) device and sign up.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How secure is Clef? =

[Very](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/05/why-we-need-real-cryptography-instead-of-passwords/). Clef leverages the computational power of your smartphone and the proven strengths of distributed, [asymmetric cryptography](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/10/asymmetric-cryptography-use/) and [multi-factor authentication](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/10/2-factor-authentication/) to provide secure WordPress logins in a beautifully simple and easy-to-use package.

Clef protects WordPress not only from insecure passwords but also from malicious forgotten password resets and bruteforce attacks.

= How secure is my data on Clef's servers? =

Clef's architecture is fully distributed so it stores no user credentials on its servers. When you use the Clef App, you create a profile and a private encryption key that never leave your phone. The Clef App uses that data to generate a unique, encrypted, digital signature every time you log in. Since all of your personal info stays on your phone, nothing in the Clef database can compromise your identity even in the unlikely event that the server is hacked.

= What if I lose my phone? =

Simply visit [Clef's "lost phone" page](https://getclef.com/lost) to deactivate your phone. Once you've deactivated, you can reactivate on a new device and all of your accounts will transfer over.

= How much does Clef cost? =

Clef is and will always be 100% free.

= Can existing users on my WordPress site sign in with Clef? =

As long as your users register on their Clef Apps using the same email address as their WordPress accounts, they can start using Clef instantly. Also, once Clef for WordPress is activated on your site, your existing WordPress users can link their accounts to Clef via the Profile page in WordPress.

= What if I have some users who do not have smartphones? =

Clef can protect WordPress in hybrid mode (passwords allowed) or full Clef mode (no passwords). If you want to enjoy the protection of full Clef mode but still need to allow passwords for users who do not have smartphones, then on the Clef Settings page you can create a secure override key that enables password logins at a secret URL.
